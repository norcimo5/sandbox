1) Previous Week - Planned

     A) Complete testing of GEO-16190 (" Calibration needs to NOT use the ts_dister record for its time sync'ing " ) as soon as hw becomes available.
     B) Complete testing of GEO-14478 ( "DRT quantization error queried at wrong time" ).
     C) Work on GEO-15367 ( "Firefly calibration does not record Noise Floor or Uncertainties" ).

2) Previous Week - Accomplished
     A) Code complete and testing of GEO-14478:
            -> Added timeout code and support for dynamic calibration.
            -> Unit testing and static calibration almost complete but waiting on test results with timeout code and dynamic calibration.
            -> Code review with Roderick Medina.

     B) Worked on GEO-15367 and is now ready for some preliminary testing.

3) Next Week - Planned
     A) Mark GEO-14478 resolved + merge with main branch as soon as testing is completed.
     B) Complete testing of GEO-16190 and GEO-15367 when test hardware becomes available.
     C) Open for new tasks.
