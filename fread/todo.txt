Put all useful functions in a utils.c/utils.h

Add code to read the exe file (done)
Add code to write the exe file back to disk (pending)
Add code to access the buffered data from structures (similar to windows)

-> Another option is to copy win32 api functionality for just those functions I'm missing and re-use the code
