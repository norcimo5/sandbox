Think up good ideas for grid boilerplate code.  Grid shouold be customizable in order to display different sizes, etc.
The low level code should work with current desktop manager environment to deliver an x * y frame/screen in a mx * my window.

Potential libs to do this (cross-platform):
    -> SDL (?)
    -> 

Also, look into other projects that have already done this:

-> oolite code(?)
-> Any decent open-source scroller.
-> It should be simple enough to do for experiments.

Another tool to consider is static images.  What about using PPM format for interesting effects? Lubuntu already knows
how to handle these images for display.
